         I started baking more seriously toward the end of 2025. At the time, 
         it was something I could do while recovering from an injury 
         a way to stay creative and occupied when my body needed to slow down. 
         It also started out very practically: I used to buy cookies as gifts for friends, 
         but it was getting expensive, so I figured I could just make them myself.

            What really pulled me in was how much baking feels like a science experiment. 
            I love understanding how each ingredient works, how they interact with one another, 
            and how small changes can completely alter the final result. Measuring, testing, adjusting, 
            and trying again became part of the fun.
        </p>

          I’m not a professional baker, just a hobbyist who genuinely enjoys baking for the joy of it, 
          experimenting in the kitchen, and sharing what I make with friends and family.
