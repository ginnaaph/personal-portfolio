          I don’t know when I started calling art a “hobby.” For a long time, it was just
          something I did naturally because I loved stationery. I enjoyed decorating my planner,
          making my notes look cute, and finding small ways to be creative during school.

          I didn’t really take art seriously until 2025. Part of that was because I never learned
          the technical side of it, and as a perfectionist, I was always focused on what felt
          wrong. I could see every flaw and every mistake, and most of my work felt like an attempt
          to replicate something I had seen rather than create something of my own. For a long
          time, that made me feel like my art wasn’t “good enough.”

          I still don’t have a defined style and I’m okay with that. Many of my pieces start as
          studies or references, but now I’m slowly learning how to move beyond exact copies. I’m
          getting more comfortable trusting my own eye, making creative decisions, and letting
          pieces be imperfect.
        </p>

          Lately, I’ve been doing a better job creating from visualization instead of imitation, 
          turning ideas in my head into something tangible. Art has become less about perfection
          and more about exploration, patience, and learning to enjoy the process.
