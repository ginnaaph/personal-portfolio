                I'm a first generation college graduate who learned early how to figure things out independently. That experience shaped
                my curiousity and  how I approach the things I do, seeking to understand how systems function, how skills connect, and how knowledge 
                can be used to support others.

                I studied public health with the goal of applying what I learned in a practical, people-centered way. Alongside that path, I developed a habit
                of teaching myself new skills, sometimes out of necessity, other times out of pure curiosity. Learning independently became a way to problem-solve, adapt, 
                and help those around me. Most of my creativity and technical work is self-taught. Over time, I have explored a wide range of interests from powerlifitng (and even
                getting certified as a personal trainer), crocheting, cooking, baking, digital and traditional art, to programming. The same range is reflected in my professional experiences
                across non-profits, healthcare, starts-ups, and litigation research. Exposure to different environments has strengthed my ability to connect ideas across disciplines and approach
                problems from multiple perspectives.

                This portfolio is a both a production project and a personal archive. It documents what I've learned, what I've built and how my thinking has evolved over time
                While I have often worked behind the scenes, this spaces represents a shift towards sharing my work with confidence and reflecting on growth through exploration and iteration.
